					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/54/Golden_Gate_Bridge_0002.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>I am a high school student from San Francisco who attends Phillip and Sala Burton High School. I am currently in the 10th grade, i was born on 7/13/00. </p>
					<p>I live with my mother, grandparents and borther and I am trying to set a good example for my little brother.I have changed in the last year or so because last  year i was failing classes and now I am passing all of them with good grades.</p>
					<p>Some of my interest are fashion, music, video games and sports. I am from the bay so i keep up with my fashion trends, my favorite pair of shoes of all time are the Raging Bull 5s because of the sentimental value they have for me. My dad gave them to me in the 7th grade once my foot grew. As for music i have always loved rap my favorite artist ATCQ, Kendrick Lamar, Kanye West and J.Cole. I have always loved video games since i started playing on the Dream Cast and PS2, my favorite game ever is probably Halo Reach just because thats the game that started me on online gaming. For sports i like football, soccer,baseball, basketball and hockey. My favorite teams for each sport are the 49ers, SF Giants, Warriors, Black Hawks and Borussia Dortmund.  </p>
